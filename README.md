Creating a calculator using Java with AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) components involves building a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. AWT provides a set of classes for creating window-based applications that are platform-independent. Below is a detailed description of how to build this calculator:

Description: Calculator using Java AWT
Objective:

To create a simple calculator application using Java's AWT components that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Components Used:

Frame: The main window of the calculator.
Buttons (Button): For digits (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /, =, C).
Text Field (TextField): To display the input and result.
Panel (Panel): To arrange the buttons in a grid layout for a neat appearance.
Functionality:

Users can click on the buttons to input numbers and operations.
The = button will calculate the result of the operation.
The CLR button will clear the input field, resetting the calculator.
The application handles basic input validation, like preventing division by zero.
Layout:

The calculator uses a GridLayout for button arrangement within a panel, ensuring that all buttons are uniformly sized.
The BorderLayout is used to position the text field at the top of the frame and the button panel below it.
Event Handling:

ActionListener is used to handle button clicks.
Logic is implemented to capture numbers and operators, perform calculations, and display the result.
Code Overview:

The main class extends Frame and implements ActionListener.
A TextField is added at the top to display current input and results.
Buttons are created and added to the panel, each associated with an ActionListener.
The actionPerformed method handles the logic for each button press, updating the display and performing calculations.
